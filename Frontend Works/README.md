# Reprogram
This README is dedicated to my capstone project on mental health and awareness in the software development community.

## About
Mental health is such an important part of our wellness as humans, but it often goes unchecked and unnoticed. Following the pandemic we saw a rapid movement in the advocacy for mental health and treatment options across the board. With that said, I've crafted this website to highlight any disparities surrounding mental health in the programming world. This site will carefully list any stats related to programmers/engineers and underlying mental ilnesses that might exist or affect them in their day to day lives as programmers.
