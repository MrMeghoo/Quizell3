The decision to outline mental health challenges and disparities in the tech field, particularly as someone living with OCD, stems from both personal and broader motivations that I can say are fueled by society. The tech industry, renowned for its rapid innovation and high-pressure environment, often exacerbates mental health issues. As an individual who navigates the everyday complexities and stigmas of OCD, I am uniquely positioned to understand the nuanced experiences of people facing similar challenges in this field.

Living with OCD has never been easy. Especially, when you find out about it late in life. However, I can say that my condition has provided me with a profound understanding of how mental health conditions can impact one's professional life. By sharing my story, I aim to shed light on the often-overlooked struggles faced by individuals with mental health conditions in tech, fostering healthy conversations and relationships in the work place and being empathetic towards other cultures.



Despite growing awareness, there remains a significant stigma around mental health in the workplace and this culture of silence prevents people from seeking the help they need and creates a perpetual cycle of suffering and misunderstanding. Which is why access to mental health resources are in great demand. My call to action through my coding works is to provide fellow developers with a place to "Git Mindful" and relax.

As well as unlocking your true potential through peace of mind and lowering stress levels. I took great pride and detail in my app to share techniques that help me on the daily to cope and heal. So, I'm looking forward to getting my product to as much people as possible with the hopes of creating a great moment that'll last a life time!
